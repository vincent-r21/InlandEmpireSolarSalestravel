/*
Program requirements:
1. If the marketing specialist begins the trip from home in Riverside, determine the variations of the trip to the noted cities that he must take to market the solar products.
2. Determine shortest path, and the most low-cost trips for the marketing specialist.
3. Create a C++ program to provide the representation of the trips, low-cost and shortest paths, including matrices, adjacencies.
4. Provide documentation that explains solution and programming approaches.
